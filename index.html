    <h2>Everett Community College - Graph130</h2>

<h3>How many quarters have you attended EvCC?</h3>
<p>This will be my 6th quarter here at EvCC</p>

<h3>What degree/certificate program are you pursuing</h3>
<p>I am pursuing a graphic design degree as well as a transferable AA</p>

<h3>Why did you choose this degree/certificate?</h3>
<p>I decided to choose a graphic design degree because I really enjoy graphic design and have been taking graphic design classes since high school. I want the transferable AA because I do not know if I will try and get another degree after my graphic design degree has been completed.</p>

<h3>What artist/designer inspires you? Why?</h3>
<p>I currently don't follow any designers or artists. However I would say that Chris Larson and Robert Lake inspire and teach me since they are my teachers and are currently both working in fields really close to my dream job</p>

<h3>What is your favorite color?  (Please, use a hex code and style your answer with that color.)</h3>
<p style="color: purple">My favorite color is Purple</p>
