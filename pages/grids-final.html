        <section class="row">
            <p class="grid-2">Here in her hot Haiti tropically trapped,
                touched by her hand’s sands, last seen
                swimming her naked as slow waves slapped,
                napping in palm fringed shadows of her sun,
                I wandered inward; blue with rain,
                she lavished pads and lilies on hushed ponds,
                finned abundance leaped her upward streams,
                I climbed her peaks of stone in delicate dawns.
                She was the final island I had reached,
                long voyaging, Columbus, de Leon,
                and, from the burning bay where I was beached
                I never turned my moorings back to Spain
                but stayed her native in a calm that charms
                the warm explorer after bone cold storms.</p>
                
            <p class="grid-2">Bruised by the wintry air
                the Dead Sea apples hold
                rigorously to boughs
                from which the weight has rolled,
                lean to the lengthening light
                here in the tree’s shadows 
                Fused to the twig’s bold spear
                locked in each open side,
                harvest dissolves in ash
                the dwindling season’s load
                and reconciles in night
                the hale, the hectic flush.
                Closed on its riddled core,
                impermeable to sun,
                flesh brandishes the thorn
                by which it was undone
                and wears the snow-tomb’s white
                silence with unconcern.</p>
    
            <p class="grid-2">We have come up short.
                The shelves are half-empty.
                The registers won’t check out.
                We have figures to show
                what comes in has gone out
                but someone neglected to pay.
                A father is fumbling his pants.
                A mother is pregnant with goods.
                Fat rustles our bones, stealing
                over muscle like a white shadow.
                The barter for groceries is not
                appetite, or flesh
                sweetened by need, or the love
                of breath. It is cash
                in the till, and we are short.
                Someone is eating our lives.
                Someone is going to pay.</p>
